### Prerequisites

The connector is created for both HelloID on-premises (using the HelloID agent) and cloud. When running this connector on-premises, make sure to have installed Windows PowerShell 5.1.

### Remarks
- As implementer, you need your own set of credentials before you can implement this connector. Therefore you need to sign a contract with the supplier.

- A School (also knows as an 'organization' within Somtoday) might have multiple departments (or vestigingen). Accounts are correlated based on the value of the 'Organization.Name' in the contract.

- The create.ps1 does not create accounts but merely correlates a HelloID person with a student in Somtoday.
